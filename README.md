## Tables

### Customer Table

The "Customer" table holds customer information, including unique customer IDs, names, email addresses, passwords, and phone numbers. Each customer entry is identified by "Customer_Id" and may have associated orders and payments.

### Order Table

The "Order" table tracks customer purchases, storing unique order identifiers, staff assigned to orders, customer IDs, order times, and product IDs. Each order is uniquely identified by "Order_Id" and associated with respective customers and products via foreign keys.

### Payment Table

The "Payment" table records transaction details, featuring unique payment identifiers, staff IDs, order IDs, payment methods, and tip amounts. Each payment entry is identified by "Payment_Id" and linked to respective orders and customers.

### Product Table

The "Product" table catalogs product details, including unique product IDs, names, cuisine types, descriptions, and prices. Each product entry is identified by "Product_Id" and may be associated with multiple orders through foreign key relationships.

### Staff Table

The "Staff" table maintains information about employees, encompassing unique staff IDs, names, roles, email addresses, and commission rates. Each staff member is identified by "Staff_Id" and may be associated with orders and payments, contributing to order handling and transaction processing.
